== What's New in 3.1 Since 3.0
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

This section covers the changes made from version 3.0 to version 3.1.
For changes in earlier version, see xref:appendix/change-history.adoc[Change History].

[[x31-kafka-client]]
=== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 3.6.0 `kafka-clients`.

[[x31-ekb]]
=== EmbeddedKafkaBroker

An additional implementation is now provided to use `Kraft` instead of Zookeeper.
See xref:testing.adoc#ekb[Embedded Kafka Broker] for more information.

[[x31-jd]]
=== JsonDeserializer

When a deserialization exception occurs, the `SerializationException` message no longer contains the data with the form `Can't deserialize data [[123, 34, 98, 97, 122, ...`; an array of numerical values for each data byte is not useful and can be verbose for large data.
When used with an `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`, the `DeserializationException` sent to the error handler contains the `data` property which contains the raw data that could not be deserialized.
When not used with an `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`, the `KafkaConsumer` will continually emit exceptions for the same record showing the topic/partition/offset and the cause thrown by Jackson.

[[x31-cpp]]
=== ContainerPostProcessor

Post processing can be applied on a listener container by specifying the bean name of a `ContainerPostProcessor` on the `@KafkaListener` annotation.
This occurs after the container has been created and after any configured `ContainerCustomizer` configured on the container factory.
See xref:kafka/container-factory.adoc[Container Factory] for more information.

[[x31-ehd]]
=== ErrorHandlingDeserializer

You can now add a `Validator` to this deserializer; if the delegate `Deserializer` successfully deserializes the object, but that object fails validation, an exception is thrown similar to a deserialization exception occurring.
This allows the original raw data to be passed to the error handler.
See xref:kafka/serdes.adoc#error-handling-deserializer[Using `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`] for more information.

[[x31-retryable]]
=== Retryable Topics
Change suffix `-retry-5000` to `-retry` when `@RetryableTopic(backoff = @Backoff(delay = 5000), attempts = "2", fixedDelayTopicStrategy = FixedDelayStrategy.SINGLE_TOPIC)`.
If you want to keep suffix `-retry-5000`, use `@RetryableTopic(backoff = @Backoff(delay = 5000), attempts = "2")`.
See xref:retrytopic/topic-naming.adoc[Topic Naming] for more information.

[[x31-c]]
=== Listener Container Changes

When manually assigning partitions, with a `null` consumer `group.id`, the `AckMode` is now automatically coerced to `MANUAL`.
See xref:tips.adoc#tip-assign-all-parts[Manually Assigning All Partitions] for more information.

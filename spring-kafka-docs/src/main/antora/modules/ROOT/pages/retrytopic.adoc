Version 2.9 changed the mechanism to bootstrap infrastructure beans; see xref:retrytopic/retry-config.adoc[Configuration] for the two mechanisms that are now required to bootstrap the feature.

Achieving non-blocking retry / dlt functionality with Kafka usually requires setting up extra topics and creating and configuring the corresponding listeners.
Since 2.7 Spring for Apache Kafka offers support for that via the `@RetryableTopic` annotation and `RetryTopicConfiguration` class to simplify that bootstrapping.

IMPORTANT: Non-blocking retries are not supported with xref:kafka/receiving-messages/listener-annotation.adoc#batch-listeners[Batch Listeners].

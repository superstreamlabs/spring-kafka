= Obtaining the Consumer `group.id`
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

When running the same listener code in multiple containers, it may be useful to be able to determine which container (identified by its `group.id` consumer property) that a record came from.

You can call `KafkaUtils.getConsumerGroupId()` on the listener thread to do this.
Alternatively, you can access the group id in a method parameter.

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "id", topicPattern = "someTopic")
public void listener(@Payload String payload, @Header(KafkaHeaders.GROUP_ID) String groupId) {
    ...
}
----

IMPORTANT: This is available in record listeners and batch listeners that receive a `List<?>` of records.
It is **not** available in a batch listener that receives a `ConsumerRecords<?, ?>` argument.
Use the `KafkaUtils` mechanism in that case.

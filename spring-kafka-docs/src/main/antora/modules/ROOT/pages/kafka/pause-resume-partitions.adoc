= Pausing and Resuming Partitions on Listener Containers
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Since version 2.7 you can pause and resume the consumption of specific partitions assigned to that consumer by using the `pausePartition(TopicPartition topicPartition)` and `resumePartition(TopicPartition topicPartition)` methods in the listener containers.
The pausing and resuming take place respectively before and after the `poll()` similar to the `pause()` and `resume()` methods.
The `isPartitionPauseRequested()` method returns true if pause for that partition has been requested.
The `isPartitionPaused()` method returns true if that partition has effectively been paused.

Also since version 2.7 `ConsumerPartitionPausedEvent` and `ConsumerPartitionResumedEvent` instances are published with the container as the `source` property and the `TopicPartition` instance.

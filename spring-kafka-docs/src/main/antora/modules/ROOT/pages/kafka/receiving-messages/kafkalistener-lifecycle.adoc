= `@KafkaListener` Lifecycle Management

The listener containers created for `@KafkaListener` annotations are not beans in the application context.
Instead, they are registered with an infrastructure bean of type `KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry`.
This bean is automatically declared by the framework and manages the containers' lifecycles; it will auto-start any containers that have `autoStartup` set to `true`.
All containers created by all container factories must be in the same `phase`.
See xref:kafka/receiving-messages/message-listener-container.adoc#container-auto-startup[Listener Container Auto Startup] for more information.
You can manage the lifecycle programmatically by using the registry.
Starting or stopping the registry will start or stop all the registered containers.
Alternatively, you can get a reference to an individual container by using its `id` attribute.
You can set `autoStartup` on the annotation, which overrides the default setting configured into the container factory.
You can get a reference to the bean from the application context, such as auto-wiring, to manage its registered containers.
The following examples show how to do so:

[source, java]
----
@KafkaListener(id = "myContainer", topics = "myTopic", autoStartup = "false")
public void listen(...) { ... }

----

[source, java]
----
@Autowired
private KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry registry;

...

    this.registry.getListenerContainer("myContainer").start();

...
----

The registry only maintains the life cycle of containers it manages; containers declared as beans are not managed by the registry and can be obtained from the application context.
A collection of managed containers can be obtained by calling the registry's `getListenerContainers()` method.
Version 2.2.5 added a convenience method `getAllListenerContainers()`, which returns a collection of all containers, including those managed by the registry and those declared as beans.
The collection returned will include any prototype beans that have been initialized, but it will not initialize any lazy bean declarations.

IMPORTANT: Endpoints registered after the application context has been refreshed will start immediately, regardless of their `autoStartup` property, to comply with the `SmartLifecycle` contract, where `autoStartup` is only considered during application context initialization.
An example of late registration is a bean with a `@KafkaListener` in prototype scope where an instance is created after the context is initialized.
Starting with version 2.8.7, you can set the registry's `alwaysStartAfterRefresh` property to `false` and then the container's `autoStartup` property will define whether or not the container is started.
